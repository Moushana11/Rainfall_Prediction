# Rainfall Prediction Project

## Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting rainfall amounts based on various meteorological data. Utilizing machine learning techniques, this model seeks to enhance our understanding and prediction capabilities concerning rainfall patterns, which is crucial for agricultural planning, water resource management, and emergency preparedness against extreme weather conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moushana11/Rainfall_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rainfall-prediction
   ```

### Setting Up Your Branch
Before you start making changes, ensure you're working on your own branch:
1. Checkout to your branch (replace "yourname" with your actual branch name):
   ```bash
   git checkout yourname
   ```
   If your branch does not exist, create it and switch to it:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b yourname
   ```

### Running the Notebook
To run the notebook and see the prediction models in action, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the `Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in the browser and run the cells sequentially to see the results.

### Contributing to the Repository
To contribute to the Rainfall Prediction project, follow these steps to push your changes:
1. Stage the changes for commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"
   ```
3. Push the changes to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin yourname
   ```
